Select any 3 from the following 4 approaches to obtain classification models for the dataset TicTacToe:
1.	Neural Networks
2.	Support Vector Machines
3.	Random Forest 
4.	Decision Trees

Requirements for Assignment3:
•	Accuracy of classification algorithms should be measured using 10-fold cross validation. 
•	Classification models that achieve higher accuracies will get more points.
•	In your report after comparing the experimental results, write a paragraph or two trying to explain/speculate why, in your opinion one classification algorithm outperformed the others.
•	Include a brief discussion in your report, how you have selected the parameters of particular data mining algorithms. 
•	In the report also include a brief description of the software you have used in the project.
•	Finally, at the end of your report provide a 1-2 paragraphs summary that summarizes your most important findings of Assignment3 
•	Your report must contain all the results you obtained for the 3 classification models as only the report will be graded.
•	R supports support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests. However, you can use any tool you like for Assignment3; e.g. scikit-learn is another popular tool.
